# E-Portfolio Project

https://alihaydarsucu.github.io/portfolio/


This E-Portfolio Project was an assignment in the School of Foreign Languages, Ankara Yildirim Beyazit University.

The assignment aimed to develop students' foreign language skills in digital spaces as well as providing room for them to reflect on their learning process. 


Eventually students presented their eportfolios at the FLE Joint Conference (June 7, 2024) with the title “Beyond Self: E-Portfolios & Ecological Second Language Motivation”.
