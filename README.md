This E-Portfolio project was a school assignment in the School of Foreign Languages of Ankara Yildirim Beyazit University. 

It was a capstone assignment to develop foreign language skills and to reflect on students' foreign language learning process, their process of expressing themselves in that language 
and to present it in the presentation “Beyond Self: E-Portfolios & Ecological Second Language Motivation”.
